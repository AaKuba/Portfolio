# Real scientific projects
As part of the activity at university, I've had a chance to prepare an analysis from real scientific data:
1) Literature review - available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15640143).
   
2) [Dashboard](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/e11f87003f9d5c86531726e7679ecadd8fe39eef/Scientific%20dashboard.pdf) from a report - a description can be found [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/d81c718e847164bc03c56abdb660f00f0e464316/Projects%20files/Description%20-%20scientific%20dashboard).

Upcoming projects: literature reviews about ESKAPE pathogens, original articles about vitamin C in fighting pathogens, environmental and social analysis.

# Project 1 
This project focuses on the basic analysis of flights in India. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data).
The dashboard was prepared in Power BI and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/82b014445bdb92e48c4f2813b66fd2e4f5c809c2/Flight%20analysis%20dashboard.pbix).
Also, SQL code was prepared that could be used for data extraction, on which the dashboard had been based and is available [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/fa9b092ca693a3410a5078e0fadb6b08f203f891/Projects%20files/Project%201%20-%20flight%20analysis%20SQL%20code).

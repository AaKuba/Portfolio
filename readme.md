# Real scientific projects
As part of the activity at university, I've had a chance to prepare an analysis from real scientific data:
1) Literature review - available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15640143).
   
2) [Dashboard](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/e11f87003f9d5c86531726e7679ecadd8fe39eef/Scientific%20dashboard.pdf) from a report - a description can be found [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/d81c718e847164bc03c56abdb660f00f0e464316/Projects%20files/Description%20-%20scientific%20dashboard).
3) Report on the effects of the funding program for the agriculture sector - LLM were used for translations the original paper, available [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/fe725c8ed851efdfcdc2808ddca7bfb91bfe76a4/Projects%20files/Jakub%20Mazur%20-%20O%20efektach%20statystycznych%20poddzia%C5%82ania%206%2C2%20ENG.pdf).

Upcoming projects: literature reviews about ESKAPE pathogens, original articles about vitamin C in fighting pathogens, and environmental and social analysis.

# Project 1 
This project focuses on the basic analysis of flights in India. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data).
The dashboard was prepared in Power BI and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/3ecf810c7d119ce906bbea2917deb0516db4ee75/Projects%20files/Flight%20analysis%20porfolio.pbix).
Also, SQL code was prepared that could be used for data extraction, on which the dashboard had been based and is available [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/fa9b092ca693a3410a5078e0fadb6b08f203f891/Projects%20files/Project%201%20-%20flight%20analysis%20SQL%20code).

Bulletpoints of the analysis:
1) The Indian market is dominated by economy class flights - over 2 times more flights categorized as economy class (A)
2) The most popular airline is Vistara and is one of the two airlines that offer business class flights (B)
3) The cheapest airlines offering economy class flights is AirAsia, and for business class flights it's Air India (data not shown)
4) The most popular destination was Mumbai (C)
5) The most expensive destination, despite of the class of the flight, was Kolkata (D)
6) The most expensive flights (for both classes) depart from Kolkata (data not shown)
7) No strong correlation can be found between flight distance and price, for both classes (E)
8) Business and economy class flights that depart in the morning tend to be the most expensive (data not shown)

Based on the conclusions, we can recommend:
1) Taking night or even late-night flights to reduce the costs of travelling
2) Choosing AirAsia or Air India to reduce the costs of travelling (depends on the desired class)
3) Avoiding travelling to Kolkata to reduce the costs
4) Considering investments in Mumbai's tourist sector, as it's the most popular destination for flights

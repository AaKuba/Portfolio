# Real scientific projects
As part of the activity at university, I've had a chance to prepare an analysis from real scientific data:
1) Literature review - available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15640143)
   
2) [Dashboard](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/e11f87003f9d5c86531726e7679ecadd8fe39eef/Scientific%20dashboard.pdf) from a report:
  Section A) Y-axis: Mean percentage values for the MTT assay with SD. X-axis: Control (Ctrl.) sample and tested etoposide concentrations.
  Section B) From left: 1) Chart of RFU values for HeLa samples with added MitoSOX probe (λex=510 nm, λem=580 nm), with SD values. 2) Chart of percentage change for individual HeLa samples with added MitoSOX probe relative to the control (100%)     at two time points. 3) Chart of RFU values for HeLa samples with added DHE probe (λex=518 nm, λem=605 nm), with SD values. 4) Chart of percentage change for individual HeLa samples with added DHE probe relative to the control (100%) at two time   points. X-axis: Etoposide concentration used to treat the cells and control value (Ctrl.). Statistical significance markings (based on multiple t-test values): ns (p>0.05), * (p<0.05), ** (p<0.01), *** (p<0.001).
  Section C) Images illustrating the control culture (photo 1) and the culture after etoposide treatment and staining at two time points: 24 hours (photo 2) and 7 days (photo 3). Bar chart of the etoposide-treated culture with a breakdown by        incubation time – the percentage of cells with signs of senescence in the analyzed sample is placed above the bar.

# Project 1 
This project focuses on the basic analysis of flights in India. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data).
The dashboard was prepared in Power BI and can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AaKuba/Portfolio/blob/82b014445bdb92e48c4f2813b66fd2e4f5c809c2/Flight%20analysis%20dashboard.pbix).
